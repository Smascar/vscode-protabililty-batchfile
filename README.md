# vscode-protabililty-batchfile
File for making Visual Code Studio store it's dependencies within the same folder itself, more important if you keep your text editor on a pendrive.

Why did i do this?
  Well I'm a college student and when I work at home,
                                                    I use Vs Code/Sublime
                                             in College,
                                                    We use Notepad, but i love to use VSC there too.

  Now the best part is that VSC comes in a zip file and can just be put on a pen drive. All sunshine and puppies till I realised that the 	extensions have to be downloaded again when i shift to any new pc and settings too don't survive the migration.
  
  So i made this batch file with the intent to tell the program to start with certain parameters like where to store the extension and the 	 settings/cache files.
	
	I found the syntax on Microsoft's site itself and also where does VSC store the folders.
	
**Store this file in the folder itself to open VSC click on this file and not on the application**
